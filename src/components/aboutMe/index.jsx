      <p>
        I am Anurag, professionally working in software development since 2014.
        Needless to say, I am loving <span role="img">üòé</span> what I am doing
        as a career. <br />I feel lucky to get an opportunity to apply my
        theoritical knowledge from my thesis ({" "}
        <a href="/assets/thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Bangla Speech Corpus For Large Vocabulary ASR System
        </a>{" "}
        ) as a reality in my current job. I have built a NLP micro-service to
        give our system an Artificial Intelligence. <br />
        Other than that, I love developing webapps and mobile apps using React,
        Vue.js, React Native and try new Js frameworks. I am trying to learn
        Algorithms and solve problems online a daily habit.{" "}
        <span role="img"> ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </span> <br />
        And yeaah, I love travelling and experiencing different food, culture
        and people. Life is more than just solving problems everyday. It's a
        journey and I just love living the present.
