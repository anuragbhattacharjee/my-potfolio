      "I recently worked with Anurag on a healthcare IT tool and he was a pleasure to work with and was very collaborative. We met on a weekly basis and discussed challenges and how to mitigate them. He was receptive to feedback but was also effective at providing his opinion for optimizing the tool. In addition, Anurag consistently provided me with an updated tool according to the timeline we established together. Lastly, Anurag strives to think about the client first. Where Anurag did not find the tool to be user-friendly or thought our client may get confused he was quick to point this out and help the team problem-solve.",
